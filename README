DESCRIPTION
This plugin provides movement commands to quickly go to whitespace at the end
of each line. (Usually in order to remove it).

RELATED WORKS
This plugin leverages the superior detection and customization facilities of
the companion ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim plugin (vimscript #3966), though it
can also be used without it if you're not interested in highlighting and
customizing.

Instead of jumping and deleting each occurrence manually, you can use the
companion DeleteTrailingWhitespace.vim (vimscript #3967) plugin to strip off
the trailing whitespace with one command, or even have this done automatically
on each write.

USAGE
]$                      Go to [count] next occurrence of trailing whitespace.
[$                      Go to [count] previous occurrence of trailing
                        whitespace.

Normal, operator-pending, and visual mode mappings are defined, even though
the latter two are typically less useful that the normal mode mappings. The
'wrapscan' setting applies.
